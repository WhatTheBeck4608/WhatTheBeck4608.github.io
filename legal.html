                <h2>Utah Office of Recovery Services – Child Support</h2>
                <p>A state agency dedicated to helping parents secure financial support for their children, the Utah Office of Recovery Services (ORS) ensures that both parents share in the responsibility of providing for their child.

                    <li><strong>Reasonable Accommodations:</strong> Requires schools to make adjustments (like a bigger desk, more restroom breaks, or water bottles) and provide any medical or academic supports needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Protection from Harassment:</strong> Ensures you won’t be bullied or mistreated because of pregnancy or parenting status, and gives you the right to file complaints if you are.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access to Title IX Coordinators:</strong> Every school must have a coordinator to help you get support or address concerns.</li>
